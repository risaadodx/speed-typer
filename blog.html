          Difference between sessionstorage and localstorage:
        </h4>
        <p>
          SessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that
          while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is
          cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a
          particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and
          assigned to that particular tab.

          Difference between global scope and block scope:
        </h4>
        <p>
          The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are
          known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means
          that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any
          function or conditional state can access that variable. <br />
          Block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the
          curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or
          conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to
          refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.

        <h4 class="fw-bold">How javascript event loop works:</h4>
        <p>
          The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the
          Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take
          the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack,
          which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the
          Event Loop.

      <div>
        <h4 class="fw-bold">When we get undefined in javascript:</h4>
        <p>
          A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined . A
          method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is
          being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns
          undefined if a value was not returned .
